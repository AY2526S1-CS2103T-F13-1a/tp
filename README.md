* UniContactsPro is a desktop application **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and a simple GUI.
* It is designed for university students to manage and organize their contacts. It helps students keep track of peers, professors, mentors and CCA members in one place, with features for searching and categorising contacts
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* Key features 
  * Contact management : Store, update and delete contact information (name, phone numbers, emails, addresses, etc.)
  * Search Functionality : Find contacts quickly by name or other fields
  * Custom labels : Organise contacts into categories such as Course mates, Professors, Study Group, CCA 
* Example Scenarios
  * A student creates categories for their professors so they can find professors easily
  * A student needs to contact a project groupmate and searches for the person's phone number
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
